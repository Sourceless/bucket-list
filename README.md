Laurence's programming bucket list
===========

No specific order to any of these. Also limited to CS/Programming.

##General
Goal | Details/Reason | Status
--- | --- | ---
Get better at Vim | Need to be faster! | 
Learn to touchtype properly, in Dvorak | Can;t be having RSI later in life. Plus, efficiency. | 

##Programming Languages
Goal | Details/Reason | Status
--- | --- | ---
Learn Lisp | I've heard far too many good things about it to ignore it | 
Learn Haskell | Expanding out to purely functional langauges | In Progress
Learn Erlang/Go | Concurrency is a big issue, plus it's damn interesting | 
Get better at C | Seriously, most software is based upon it, I should know it well. |
Learn x86 and/or ARM assembly language | Another little interest. | 

##Frameworks
Goal | Details/Reason | Status
--- | --- | ---
Learn node.js | Even though I'm not a big fan of JavaScript, there must be some reason for all the hype. Plus expanding your horizons is always good. | 
Learn Django | I've been putting this off for too long. |

##Operating Systems
Goal | Details/Reason | Status
--- | --- | ---
Install and run Plan 9 | Apparently it's the future. | 
Install and run Arch Linux as a primary OS | |
Install and run a BSD | | 
Do a Linux from Scratch build | | 
Use a tiling window manager | xmonad, dwm, awesome maybe | 

##Projects
Goal | Details/Reason | Status
--- | --- | ---
Create a web framework | No good reason, there's already loads but that doesn't mean it's not a good project | 
Create a resource-based API framework | Okay, I already started this. But there must be a more declarative(?) way to do it. | In Progress
Clone some retro games | Games were the reason I got into computers, and i need to makes some | 
Make an FPS | Because I've wanted to for a long time. | 
Make an RPG/Adventure Game | Same reason. |
Make a game for a legacy system | Game boy, or maybe NES | 
Write an emulator for a legacy system | Help understand some 'exotic' architectures better | 
Make an operating system | To better understand, well, OSes in general | 
Write an operating system in Lisp | Because it's been a long time since it was done |
Do a project involving distributed systems | They seem like they're going to be the way forward | 
Do something silly with neural nets | Mostly to learn about them | 
Make an open-source mobile phone | All the ones around seem to be suspended, or dead. I think an open-source phone could be a better phone. | 
Create a toy language | To learn about compilers, interpreters, etc. | 
Create a useful programming language | And maybe even support it. | 
Find or create a PHP alternative | Hopefully a little... better while maintaining a low barrier to entry. | 
Make a Lisp Machine and open-source it | It'd be awesome. Plus the market is overrun with machines nothing like it. |
